Copper blood vs. Iron blood
I wonder if blood type has anything to do with intelligence?! Thoughts anyone? Does the rhesus factor make a difference? Does copper blood conduct better than iron?5a

Do you remember when people used to be blood tested before getting married?! This was before RHOGam was invented. The government could give two shits if you wanted to marry your cousin. This whole world is a farce.

Blood types have very little relevance, except in a blood transfusion.

Re: Copper blood vs. Iron blood
Here's another interesting factoid... Dogs have 4 blood types; cats have 11; cows have about 800.

Could there be a connection to this and alien cattle abduction/cattle mutilation? Could their blood type variations be of particular interest to aliens?

Re: Copper blood vs. Iron blood
Being RH +/- is not as clear cut as people think. Most Type A are recessive carriers of RH -, and descend from agricultural civilizations. If you have a chin, an actual chin, like the boney process on the front of your jaw, you are at least a recessive carrier of RH - gene.

I'm guessing that the copper bloods get a better education than the iron bloods, yeah?
