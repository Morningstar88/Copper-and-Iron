# Copper-and-Iron
Been eating tons of Basil. Feel amazing. 

Big copy paste from GLP. Parse it later.

Thus, it can be stated with certainty that copper is the single most important nutrient in the body. This is why copper is the target for deprivation and depletion.

Copper blood vs. Iron blood
I wonder if blood type has anything to do with intelligence?! Thoughts anyone? Does the rhesus factor make a difference? Does copper blood conduct better than iron?5a

Being RH +/- is not as clear cut as people think. Most Type A are recessive carriers of RH -, and descend from agricultural civilizations. If you have a chin, an actual chin, like the boney process on the front of your jaw, you are at least a recessive carrier of RH - gene.

Hemoglobin is iron based. It's what transports oxygen to your cells. Copper helps with iron absorption. Neither has anything to to do with your Rh factor.

Unless you are a mollusk.

Sounds like you are anemic. I would seek a doctor.

Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison! Depopulation Plan & Blood Types!
I was doing some blood typing research and came across this article that i have linked below...

This is a theory I had not heard of and was wondering how credible this information may be... I did find it very interesting to say the least. Heres the first couple paragraphs. It is kinda long but IMO worth the read...]

Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison. Iron replaces copper in the blood and tissue proteins and accumulates in
multiple locations of the body, causing destruction and
accelerating aging. Bio-available copper must be
replenished to restore health and longevity – to repair the
DNA damage.

The average blood pH in the late 1800’s ranged from 7.38-7.40 (Ref 19). Approximately during the turn of the 20th century in 1900, there appears to have been a blood pH increase, and may be when the pH was initially increased to 7.40. According to the American Heart Association, since 1900, "coronary heart disease has accounted for more deaths than any other cause or group of causes of death in the United States". In 1980 the average alkaline blood pH was set up to 7.43, and is the marker for peak U.S. population numbers due to the initial stage of population reduction, (Ref: Population Reduction Chart). The set-up to critical 7.43 would have been initiated in about 1976. The 7.43 pH level is adjacent to 7.45, the next life critical level, and would explain the steady increase in total number of deaths and declining births beginning in 1980. (Note: the year 1980 marks the peak population for the national numbers. For those states with a current official death rate of 10, the population peaked in 1967 due to an earlier population reduction schedule, set up in 1993.) The final extermination phase was initiated in 1996 and set up in 2006 at the pH level of 7.54, adjacent to the next life-critical level of 7.55 pH. This final phase of extermination marked the beginning of exploding disease prevalence, and can be researched from national health statistics data.

The Population Reduction Chart data estimates it takes about 26 years to set up the blood pH to 7.54. Then, between the 4th and 5th year of the pH set-up, the population reduction rate of about .5% per year is established, in this stage of the extermination schedule. Thus, it takes about 29-30 years to go from peak population numbers to a 0.5% annual reduction. At the 30 year point the death rate is approaching 14-15 in this stage, resulting in a yearly population reduction rate of between 0.5 - 1 %. The official population numbers conceal this reduction by inflating the total numbers, starting in 1980, by exaggerating the number of births. Calculate the actual population numbers by decreasing 1% each year start with 70% of the official 2010 numbers, 71% of 2009 numbers, etc. The U.S. population peaked at about 227 million in 1980, and is currently at about 214 million, a decrease of 5.7%. Death Rate: The reported death numbers appear to be valid up until 2006, when the final extermination phase was set up. The official death numbers for 2006 and later are understated. The death estimates for these years were calculated by using a state with an earlier extermination schedule as reference, by aligning the state and national schedules, and Census 2010 adjustments. The current death rate as of December 2011 is estimated at 14, not the official rate of 7.8.

These implications cannot be taught, they must be learned."

Re: Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison! Depopulation Plan & Blood Types!
It should read too much iron is toxic to your body. We all have trace amounts of the stuff due to the carbon we're made from. Although it should be possible for a being to be based on other elements as well, which would in turn alter the color of your blood etc, and like you say have a bearing on longevity. But I have to admit that although there are guidelines for how much iron your body should have, we all know those guidelines are probably not really 100% accurate. For example i am supposed to be obese, but I am not, I am a very tall, big boned man, with a lot of muscle mass due to my job lifting people, and things, I have the right amount of fat on my body and I have that classic six pack men always seem to want, plus I used to play rugby, which always called for muscular players.

I read this article a year or two ago...so far, it is the only "scientific" explanation that I've been able to come across that gives reason for the different blood types.

Unfortunately for me, I am not well educated in this area and can't prove or disprove this person's claims.

But it does make sense.

And my body rejects iron, too. I get very ill from iron supplements, although I had to take them as a small child.

But iron supplements make me very sick.....so maybe it is the amount of iron in them.....

There is a genetic disease that some may have that come from Caucasian peoples. It's when too much iron accumulates in the blood it can cause organ problems. It's called hemochromatosis and you can get checked for it with a test. The test can check for either a genetic marker (cheaper) that shows that your bloodline may have it or a more expensive test that shows if you do have it.

The cure is easy. Donate blood for a few months. It's real.

I agree that iron is necessary to the body, but maybe not to great amounts either. I was very sick from lack of iron, very very weak.It took about a week of adding alot of food based iron to my diet to get it back to normal. I am sure it was an iron deficiency because they drew my blood. I was very low. I think maybe food based iron is better, not so much from red meat though.

Don't believe the old wives' tales.
To get enough iron from Guinness to make a difference to your health you would have to drink and awful lot of it, roughly around 15 pints to get the same amount of iron as cereal.

Call me old-fashioned but drinking that much would have a far more negative effect on your body than the iron would have a positive effect.

And even oxygen at higher concentration for prolonged periods can cause toxicity. Low iron can cause anemia. I see patients every day who take iron supplements, some are in their late 80's to early 90's. In moderation, iron is good for you.

Yay! The voice of reason.

Iron is the central element in h(a)emoeglobin - the red blood corpuscles that transport oxygen throughout your body (veins/arteries/capillaries/tissues/cells) and enable your metabolism/cellular respiration.

Yes, it should be ingested in the form of colloidal iron - as transmuted by osmotic uptake via vegetables, or by eating the organically stored colloidal iron contained in the meat of animals that have previously eaten and metabolized these colloidal mineral sources.

Shit - you want to raise a REAL issue, - look at magnesium deficiency in the Western diet. Magnesium plays a role in at least 75% of biologically significant metabolic pathways through enzymatic reaction, and 95% of western diets are chronically deficient in magnesium due to modern food processing technologies.

Re: Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison! Depopulation Plan & Blood Types!
Iron is essential for blood.

The reason why your blood is read is due to the iron. The erythrocytes (Red blood cells) make up the dominate part of your blood, they are based on the iron atom.

Hemocyanin hemoglobin (copper based blood cells) are low in humans, and are found predominately in shell fish and in insects to a large degree. Those are copper based and produce bluish/greenish colored blood when red blood cells are not present.

Yes we need copper as well for healthy blood, However few of us require copper supplements.

Hemocyanin is a complex protienish type cell, it's main purpose is in respiration thus its a respiratory protein.

The reality is that the trace elements are being stripped from top soils on farms. In order to grow plants they use three chemicals (fertilizers) which are bereft of trace elements. A lot of the farmland now lacks zinc, magnesium, copper and other trace elements that the body needs.

What we now have is a lack of elements in our daily diets. And taking supplements does not help, most of the supplements are essentially ground up elements, not water dissolved elements as you would find in plants that break down the denser molecules into single atoms and deposit those atoms of elements in their tissues which then recombine with things like oxygen to make oxides.

Taking Iron does not deplete copper. Not eating plants that have copper in them causes copper depletion.

Boosting with B-12 and eating things high in copper is the only way to fix that. Sesame seeds, Chocolate, Liver all of these are high in copper. and more often than not high in iron as well as the two metal go pretty much hand in hand in lifeforms on earth.

Perhaps crops could be make iron-less and contain more copper by altering the soil it is grown in?

But seriously most of our foods contain copper so.

Unless it was in our ancient past spread around all the soil in the world to make all the food rich in copper.

So what about the supposed copper based blood types then, if they ate iron rich foods, wouldn't it suck for them?

Iron is essential for blood.

The reason why your blood is read is due to the iron. The erythrocytes (Red blood cells) make up the dominate part of your blood, they are based on the iron atom.

Hemocyanin hemoglobin (copper based blood cells) are low in humans, and are found predominately in shell fish and in insects to a large degree. Those are copper based and produce bluish/greenish colored blood when red blood cells are not present.

Yes we need copper as well for healthy blood, However few of us require copper supplements.

Hemocyanin is a complex protienish type cell, it's main purpose is in respiration thus its a respiratory protein.

The reality is that the trace elements are being stripped from top soils on farms. In order to grow plants they use three chemicals (fertilizers) which are bereft of trace elements. A lot of the farmland now lacks zinc, magnesium, copper and other trace elements that the body needs.

What we now have is a lack of elements in our daily diets. And taking supplements does not help, most of the supplements are essentially ground up elements, not water dissolved elements as you would find in plants that break down the denser molecules into single atoms and deposit those atoms of elements in their tissues which then recombine with things like oxygen to make oxides.

Taking Iron does not deplete copper. Not eating plants that have copper in them causes copper depletion.

Boosting with B-12 and eating things high in copper is the only way to fix that. Sesame seeds, Chocolate, Liver all of these are high in copper. and more often than not high in iron as well as the two metal go pretty much hand in hand in lifeforms on earth.
 Quoting: Bowyn Aerrow 


I agree, to a point.

However, I'd put to you that taking supplements that ARE plant based are NOT a waste of effort.

How do you feel about supplementing a diet with a concentrated form of bio-available nutrients in the form of a eucaryotic single cell algae (such as chlorella) where you are consuming the whole plant- if it is cultivated in sanitary conditions?

Re: Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison! Depopulation Plan & Blood Types!
There is a genetic disease that some may have that come from Caucasian peoples. It's when too much iron accumulates in the blood it can cause organ problems. It's called hemochromatosis and you can get checked for it with a test. The test can check for either a genetic marker (cheaper) that shows that your bloodline may have it or a more expensive test that shows if you do have it.

The cure is easy. Donate blood for a few months. It's real.
 Quoting: D'Light 

This^^^

Hemochromatosis is indeed hereditary and a only a few of my family members have it so its passed down, but not to everyone.

My father was the first to be diagnosed and he goes to the Dr regularly to have blood taken out.

My twin sister also has it, but she generally doesn't need to take any action as the Dr advised that she loses sufficient iron every month with her period.

My two elder brothers and I were cleared after being tested.

Hemochromatosis is a serious condition.

However, iron in your diet will be present in two different forms: elemental, or colloidal; - 'pre-digested'.

Your body is genetically programmed to process, assimilate and metabolically utilize colloidal iron from plant or animal origins in their colloidal format.

'Elemental' iron ranks as one of the most toxic of metals introduced into the human diet: - especially for those who are susceptible to 'overload' uptake due to a dietary deficiency in its agonistic counterparts.

It's a complex biochemical arrangement, and this is not the space in which to discuss this (nor should you take advice from internet keyboard jockeys).

My take: Never take an isolated iron supplement, un-supervised, unless it's a component of a regimen suggested by a qualified health professional who understands the difference in the two forms (elemental and colloidal).

Flame away, pharmatards ...

Poison?

If we all came from a trail of dust in space, what do you think that/those components are?


Here, I hate to quote wiki, but it's all I have the energy for at this moment:

Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in molasses, teff and farina. Iron in meat (heme iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables.[58] Although some studies suggest that heme/hemoglobin from red meat has effects which may increase the likelihood of colorectal cancer,[59][60] there is still some controversy,[61] and even a few studies suggesting that there is not enough evidence to support such claims.[62]
Iron provided by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one third to two thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate),[63] is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids[64] and is also available for use as a common iron supplement. Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to "iron glycinate" supplements.[65] The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron (heme-based iron has higher bioavailability).[66] Infants may require iron supplements if they are bottle-fed cow's milk.[67] Blood donors and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake.[68]

Iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake.[74] Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, such as hemochromatosis. Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians.[75]
MRI finds that iron accumulates in the hippocampus of the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease and in the substantia nigra of those with Parkinson disease.[76]

All well and good ...

BUT - investigate mineral antagonism from a dietary standpoint - 'The Mineral Wheel' as proposed by Dr. Robert Erdmann (et al.,) in "The Amino Acid Revolution"

Then investigate the decimation of dietary essential minerals in crop-producing soils due to the effects of intensive 'NPK' fertilizer usage over the past 60 years or so.

(Edit to add: NPK = Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium additives)

Report back once you've done your 'research'.

Is all 'as it seems' ?

An interesting sidebar:

Iron forms the core element of hemoglobin; - our 'lifeblood'

Magnesium is the core component of chlorophyll - every plant's 'lifeblood'.

Structurally. these compounds are almost identical.

The only major difference between our 'blood' and plant blood is a few numbers on the Periodic Table of the Elements.

Ponder ... deeply.

Discuss.

Poisoning of Mankind - Blood Types, Copper Deficiency, Evolution Theory & Illuminati



Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison. Iron replaces copper in the blood and tissue proteins and accumulates in multiple locations of the body, causing destruction and accelerating aging. Bio-available copper must be replenished to restore health and longevity – to repair the DNA damage.


The Blood Typing Farce: Nearly 95% of the population, who have blood type O and A which are the thinnest blood and lowest blood volume, and blood type B, have iron poisoning and copper deficiency, due to accumulation of iron from iron added to the food/food chain, iron uptake facilitators and copper depleters/antagonists that they have thoroughly saturated the food and water supply with. (See: USDA Food Supply Nutrient (1909-2005) Schedules, and additional iron & copper comments below.) These are in addition to radiation and vaccine poisons, (Military: see Anthrax Vaccine comments), which are quicker and more effective methods for depleting copper, and are primary methods for expediting our death.

Vaccines were designed to implant sub-microscopic, nanoparticle parasites, (termed “viruses”), and adjuvant to deplete liver copper. The parasites settle, thrive & replicate in the presence of iron deposits and copper deficiency, and accelerate the destruction process by increasing the synthesis rate of abnormal toxic proteins; the consequences being an increasingly defective blood supply, inflammation, secondary bacterial infections, lesions, degeneration, fibrosis, tumors, and cancer.
The purpose of depleting liver copper with vaccine adjuvant: When the body is invaded by pathogens/viruses, copper is mobilized from the liver in order to neutralize/destroy them. Bacteria and viruses transition from the dormant state (time of injection) to the active state of thriving and replicating as iron stores increase and copper status depletes. [link to www.unveilingthem.com]
The measles vaccine pathogen has been found in diseased colons of patients -- iron is taken into the body via ingestion and the gastrointestinal tract, and thus is a location for a greater proportion of iron accumulation. Measles settles in the mucosal linings of tissues/organs and other locations of iron deposits – that is, where copper has been depleted or displaced from. The parasite (“virus”) implanted by the vaccines coupled with the iron deposits accelerates the synthesis rate of abnormal toxic proteins; the consequences being inflammation, secondary bacterial infections, lesions, degeneration, tumors and cancer. The synthesis rate of toxic proteins increases as copper status depletes and iron stores increase, overwhelming the immune system and inevitably causing the demise of the host. (The MMR Measles vaccine in addition to other vaccines was initially forced on the population beginning with the baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964.)

 Quoting: MindShaft 



"Iron is essential for oxygen transport in the blood": Iron attracts oxygen, thereby causing free radicals, and facilitating the growth of parasites; subsequently stimulating the growth of tumors, cancers and bacteria.



"Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)": IDA is characterized as abnormal size/count of blood cells, accompanied by low blood iron levels. IDA is often described as being secondary to copper deficiency as well as to another concurrent disease or condition. Documentation also indicates that copper is needed to mobilize iron from deposit ("storage") sites into the blood. (This is where the copper deficiency comes in.) So, sub-optimal levels of copper will mobilize some iron from deposit locations into the blood; however, will not be enough to excrete the iron. If optimal healthy levels of copper are taken in and maintained in the diet, ALL the iron would be mobilized out of deposits, neutralized and excreted from the body. At the same time copper would replace the iron in the blood and tissue proteins, build normal blood cells to healthy levels, and neutralize the blood pH to 7.00.

Have you not heard about 'anti-oxidants'?

It's all about balance

'Life' in the human form, is a constant battle between oxidation and reduction (anti-oxidation).

Oxidation is required to power cellular respiration via the constant generation, reduction and re-generation of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) cycle for cellular energy.

Anti-oxidants recycle this energy via reducing compounds (vitamins A, C and E, - plus ALA (thioctic acid) and Co-Q10 or 'Ubiquinone') thus providing building blocks for recycling anti-oxidative, power-building and shredding compounds, in a cycle that doesn't quit, until the input calories quit.

If your body didn't have the capacity for oxidation and reduction, you wouldn't be able to fight off a mild 'flu infection. Macrophages (your most primitive immune cell, produces bursts of oxidative hydrogen peroxide compounds when the immune cascade begins)

Without oxidation and reduction in a constant battle for equilibrium - you'd be a corpse.

Don't take my word for it - study a little biochemistry - especially the Kreb's cycle.

BTW - iron is absolutely an essential mineral - in it's pre-digested, colloidal form.

What say you?

Re: Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison! Depopulation Plan & Blood Types!
Copper Functions as the Primary Antioxidant: Copper maintains mineral balance, thus a balanced pH with normal blood viscosity, by functioning as the primary antioxidant in the body. When the blood is of normal viscosity with optimal blood flow, the blood is able to rid the body of toxic metals -- iron, chemicals, and any overload of other minerals, (and harmful bacteria and viruses), thereby retaining and balancing out the nutrient minerals. It has been documented that a "decrease in antioxidant protection caused by copper deficiency goes beyond a decrease in the activity of copper-dependent enzymes by inducing a wide range of disturbances in the other enzyme systems. (Ref 4)" This is because copper provides a balanced neutral pH of 7.00 that is required by these enzyme systems in order to activate and function at normal levels. Enzymes are made up of proteins and if any are missing or malformed due to copper deficiency, they do not activate and function at normal levels. These other enzyme systems are involved in the formation of bone and connective tissue, immune system, cardiovascular and heart, brain, liver, blood vessels, pigmentation, collagen and elastin, blood clotting factors, all the glandular systems, and many others. (Ref 4) Thus, it can be stated with certainty that copper is the single most important nutrient in the body. This is why copper is the target for deprivation and depletion.

Re: Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison! Depopulation Plan & Blood Types!
I was doing some blood typing research and came across this article that i have linked below...

This is a theory I had not heard of and was wondering how credible this information may be... I did find it very interesting to say the least. Heres the first couple paragraphs. It is kinda long but IMO worth the read...]

Iron is NOT a nutrient, it is a poison. Iron replaces copper in the blood and tissue proteins and accumulates in
multiple locations of the body, causing destruction and
accelerating aging. Bio-available copper must be
replenished to restore health and longevity – to repair the
DNA damage.

The average blood pH in the late 1800’s ranged from 7.38-7.40 (Ref 19). Approximately during the turn of the 20th century in 1900, there appears to have been a blood pH increase, and may be when the pH was initially increased to 7.40. According to the American Heart Association, since 1900, "coronary heart disease has accounted for more deaths than any other cause or group of causes of death in the United States". In 1980 the average alkaline blood pH was set up to 7.43, and is the marker for peak U.S. population numbers due to the initial stage of population reduction, (Ref: Population Reduction Chart). The set-up to critical 7.43 would have been initiated in about 1976. The 7.43 pH level is adjacent to 7.45, the next life critical level, and would explain the steady increase in total number of deaths and declining births beginning in 1980. (Note: the year 1980 marks the peak population for the national numbers. For those states with a current official death rate of 10, the population peaked in 1967 due to an earlier population reduction schedule, set up in 1993.) The final extermination phase was initiated in 1996 and set up in 2006 at the pH level of 7.54, adjacent to the next life-critical level of 7.55 pH. This final phase of extermination marked the beginning of exploding disease prevalence, and can be researched from national health statistics data.

The Population Reduction Chart data estimates it takes about 26 years to set up the blood pH to 7.54. Then, between the 4th and 5th year of the pH set-up, the population reduction rate of about .5% per year is established, in this stage of the extermination schedule. Thus, it takes about 29-30 years to go from peak population numbers to a 0.5% annual reduction. At the 30 year point the death rate is approaching 14-15 in this stage, resulting in a yearly population reduction rate of between 0.5 - 1 %. The official population numbers conceal this reduction by inflating the total numbers, starting in 1980, by exaggerating the number of births. Calculate the actual population numbers by decreasing 1% each year start with 70% of the official 2010 numbers, 71% of 2009 numbers, etc. The U.S. population peaked at about 227 million in 1980, and is currently at about 214 million, a decrease of 5.7%. Death Rate: The reported death numbers appear to be valid up until 2006, when the final extermination phase was set up. The official death numbers for 2006 and later are understated. The death estimates for these years were calculated by using a state with an earlier extermination schedule as reference, by aligning the state and national schedules, and Census 2010 adjustments. The current death rate as of December 2011 is estimated at 14, not the official rate of 7.8.

Idiot,

Iron is needed chemically for the oxygen exchange to work in blood. Iron has NOTHING to do with the PH of blood.

Women especially need to intake iron because of blood loss through menstrual bleeding.

As for YOUR poison claim? EVERYTHING has a toxicity level including H2O.

That's crazy. You need both copper and iron (a lot more iron though). Your blood I'd largely made up of iron. Not enough and you will become anemic. If you know an anemic person you'll see they are not healthy at all.

Many foods are high in copper AND iron, its not an either-or.

Make sure not to overdo it, but you definitely need both of these essential minerals!

Then; why - please, PLEASE tell me - is the human red blood cell - the corpuscle - dependent on iron to transport oxygen to every cell in your body?
 Quoting: MindShaft 


How do you explain iron-deficiency anemia?
 Quoting: MindShaft 



"Iron is essential for oxygen transport in the blood": Iron attracts oxygen, thereby causing free radicals, and facilitating the growth of parasites; subsequently stimulating the growth of tumors, cancers and bacteria.



"Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)": IDA is characterized as abnormal size/count of blood cells, accompanied by low blood iron levels. IDA is often described as being secondary to copper deficiency as well as to another concurrent disease or condition. Documentation also indicates that copper is needed to mobilize iron from deposit ("storage") sites into the blood. (This is where the copper deficiency comes in.) So, sub-optimal levels of copper will mobilize some iron from deposit locations into the blood; however, will not be enough to excrete the iron. If optimal healthy levels of copper are taken in and maintained in the diet, ALL the iron would be mobilized out of deposits, neutralized and excreted from the body. At the same time copper would replace the iron in the blood and tissue proteins, build normal blood cells to healthy levels, and neutralize the blood pH to 7.00.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 21180229 


anti-oxidents fight a process called oxidization (typically of fats). They do not remove oxygen from your blood.
Have you not heard about 'anti-oxidants'?

It's all about balance

'Life' in the human form, is a constant battle between oxidation and reduction (anti-oxidation).

Oxidation is required to power cellular respiration via the constant generation, reduction and re-generation of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) cycle for cellular energy.

Anti-oxidants recycle this energy via reducing compounds (vitamins A, C and E, - plus ALA (thioctic acid) and Co-Q10 or 'Ubiquinone') thus providing building blocks for recycling anti-oxidative, power-building and shredding compounds, in a cycle that doesn't quit, until the input calories quit.

If your body didn't have the capacity for oxidation and reduction, you wouldn't be able to fight off a mild 'flu infection. Macrophages (your most primitive immune cell, produces bursts of oxidative hydrogen peroxide compounds when the immune cascade begins)

Without oxidation and reduction in a constant battle for equilibrium - you'd be a corpse.

Don't take my word for it - study a little biochemistry - especially the Kreb's cycle.

BTW - iron is absolutely an essential mineral - in it's pre-digested, colloidal form.

What say you?

different forms of iron. some forms are much more bioavailable and if in foods such as greens, have the companion nutrients for optimal absorption and assimilation.

regarding the article OP posted, this is a highly unlikely scenario. Most Americans for acidic lifestyles/diets and therefore, acidic ph. I eat out of a cast iron skillet daily and do not get sick or constipated from it. Each one of you reading this, order yourselves some ph paper or test strips (if u have a fish tank, you might already have some). Test your urine or saliva with them. I guarantee 90% of you will be in the acidic range.

I do not deny their is an extermination program in play but it is not death by alkalinity. Iron is an important nutrient and helps control COPPER toxicity which is rampant these days. Copper toxicity can cause serious mental disorders. Be careful adding it supplementally into your regimen.

I'm a normal, healthy woman who tends to run slightly anemic. During both my pregnancies, the doctors wanted me to take iron supplementation, but my body simply will not allow it. The stomach pain I get from an iron pill is excruciating.

Rather than supplementing, I cook in an iron skillet and eat more spinach.

For me, those little red iron pills ARE poison and my body rejects them.
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 1578124 


Same here! I'm a negative blood type and iron does not agree with me at all. Im currently pregnant (told I'm anemic) & the only prenatal vitamins that I've been offered have iron in them. They make my stomach burn & I also get extremely nauseous upon ingesting them. I'm taking a daily multivitamin minus iron instead. Since I'm quite healthy, I don't see the need to supplement my typical iron intake. I assume that my body is trying to tell me something if I take iron & it doesn't agree with me.

I thought science discovered years ago that it was best to run just slightly below a normal level for iron. Not so much as to be anemic, but low enough not to cause organ damage and inflammation.

If anybody is worried about their levels, just make sure they get a blood test at their annual physical and give blood every few weeks. No big deal.

Counter study

Abstract
Feeding copper gluconate in the drinking water to C57BL/6J male for a lifetime decreased the mean survival times by 14.4% when given at a concentration of 5 X 10(-3) M (317 ppm copper). The maximum life span was reduced by 12.8% (from 986 to 874 days). Survival data at lower copper concentrations are also reported. Serum, brain, heart and kidney copper concentrations were unaltered by feeding 5 X 10(-3) M copper gluconate. Only liver concentrations increased. Cadmium concentrations in liver and kidney of 168-, 406- and 644-day-old mice were essentially unchanged after feeding copper gluconate for 104 days. We conclude that chronic consumption of copper does not prevent or reduce the normal accumulation of cadmium found in aging mice

There is a genetic disease that some may have that come from Caucasian peoples. It's when too much iron accumulates in the blood it can cause organ problems. It's called hemochromatosis and you can get checked for it with a test. The test can check for either a genetic marker (cheaper) that shows that your bloodline may have it or a more expensive test that shows if you do have it.

Ever hear of a disorder called Wilson's disease op? It's when the body has too much copper so it causes schizophrenia like personality changes and possibly organ damage.


Humans like all mammals need iron in our blood. Copper is needed too but in much smaller amounts.

Copper, iron, and zinc compete for absorption in the body. Iron usually wins. Hemoglobin in our blood is mostly composed of iron.

In theory, 8% of the earth's crust is composed of iron. It's the most abundant metal on earth. Because of the circle of life the plants absorb the iron, the animals eat the plants, we eat the animals as well as the plants. There is no escaping iron.

Unless you are an alien life form that was dropped here on earth then odds are you are evolved to need iron.

If it were possible for you to chelate all iron from your body then you would become severely anemic and die.
